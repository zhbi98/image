**Here mainly realizes the common image processing such as fisheye correction, Gaussian blur, transparency, saturation sharpening, gray filling, arbitrary angle rotation and so on. These algorithms are implemented from the bottom through Python, and the implementation process of each algorithm is described in detail below**

# _1. Alpha_
The image is made up of a series of pixels, and the original colors of the image are displayed by the pixels emitting light.The color of each pixel of the image is composed of standard colors R, G and B.So when the image is processed by the algorithm, the RGB value of the pixel of the image is actually re-calculated A process of recombination of calculations.
