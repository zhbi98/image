**Here mainly realizes the common image processing such as fisheye correction, Gaussian blur, transparency, saturation sharpening, gray filling, arbitrary angle rotation and so on. These algorithms are implemented from the bottom through Python, and the implementation process of each algorithm is described in detail below**
